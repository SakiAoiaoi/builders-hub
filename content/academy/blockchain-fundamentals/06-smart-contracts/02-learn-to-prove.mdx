In this section, you will follow a step-by-step guide to deploy a basic smart contract. 
Think of it as compiling and deploying a little robot on the Avalanche Fuji testnet, giving it life, and then verifying it. This way, you will gain practical experience in how contracts operate on the blockchain.

### Objectives
- Write and compile a Solidity smart contract.  
- Deploy it on Avalanche Fuji using Remix and MetaMask.  
- Verify the deployed contract on SnowTrace.  

# Interact with a Smart Contract

In this challenge, you will interact with a deployed contract on the Fuji Testnet.  
If you succeed, you will earn an NFT certificate.

## Get Test Funds

To deploy and interact, you need test AVAX on Fuji.

## Deploy to Avalanche Fuji Testnet

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). If you’re new to Remix, check out [this guide](https://build.avax.network/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/deploy-with-remix-ide).

Create a new Solidity file (e.g., LittleRobot.sol) and paste:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract LittleRobot {
    string public message = "🤖 Hello! I’m a little robot now living on the Avalanche blockchain!";
}
```

2. Compile with Solidity ^0.8.20.  
   *Compiling means translating your Solidity code into bytecode that the blockchain can understand. Make sure to select the compiler version that matches the pragma specified in your contract (e.g., ^0.8.20).*

3. Connect your wallet and deploy the contract.  
   *Once deployed, a unique contract address will be generated on the blockchain — like a birth certificate proving your little robot has come to life.*

## What this contract does?

By deploying this simple contract, a little robot comes to life on the Avalanche Fuji testnet chain. When you call the `message()` function, the robot introduces itself with a friendly greeting.

# Submit Your Contract

Great job deploying your first contract 🎉  

Next, copy your **contract address** from Remix.

## Submission

Use the form below to submit your contract address:

If the address is valid, you will receive an NFT certificate (coming soon ✨).
