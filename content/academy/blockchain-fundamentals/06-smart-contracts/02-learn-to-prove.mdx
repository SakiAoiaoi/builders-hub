In this section, you will follow a step-by-step guide to deploy a basic smart contract.  
This will provide practical experience with compiling, deploying, and verifying a contract on Avalanche Fuji testnet.

### Objectives
- Write and compile a Solidity smart contract.  
- Deploy it on Avalanche Fuji using Remix and MetaMask.  
- Verify the deployed contract on SnowTrace.  

### Writing the Contract

Here is a simple contract to start with:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public message = "Hello, Avalanche!";
}
