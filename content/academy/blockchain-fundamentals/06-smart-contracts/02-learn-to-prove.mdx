In this section, you will follow a step-by-step guide to deploy a basic smart contract. 
Think of it as compiling and deploying a little robot on the Avalanche Fuji testnet, giving it life, and then verifying it. This way, you will gain practical experience in how contracts operate on the blockchain.

### Objectives
- Write and compile a Solidity smart contract.  
- Deploy it on Avalanche Fuji using Remix and MetaMask.  
- Verify the deployed contract on SnowTrace.  

# Interact with a Smart Contract

In this challenge, you will interact with a deployed contract on the Fuji Testnet.  
If you succeed, you will earn an NFT certificate.

## Add Avalanche Fuji Testnet

You can easily add the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** to MetaMask.  
Just click the **fox icon** at the bottom left of  
<a href="https://testnet.snowtrace.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Snowtrace Testnet
</a>, and it will be added with a single click.

## Get Test Funds

To deploy and interact, you need test AVAX on Fuji.  
[Get Test Funds](https://build.avax.network/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/get-test-funds)
If youâ€™re new to Remix, check out [this guide](https://build.avax.network/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/deploy-with-remix-ide).

## Deploy to Avalanche Fuji Testnet

#### 1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org). 

Create a new Solidity file (e.g., LittleRobot.sol) and paste:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract LittleRobot {
    string public message = "Hello! I am a little robot now living on the Avalanche blockchain!";
}
```

#### 2. Compile with Solidity ^0.8.20. 

^0.8.20 means any compiler version greater than or equal to 0.8.20, but lower than 0.9.0.
In other words, your contract will compile with 0.8.20, 0.8.21, 0.8.22, â€¦ but not with 0.9.0 or higher.

#### 3. Connect your wallet and deploy the contract.  

Once deployed, a unique contract address will be generated on the blockchain â€” like a birth certificate proving your little robot has come to life.

#### 4. check on SnowTrace

Open [SnowTrace Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/), paste your **contract address**, and check `message()` under **Read Contract** to see your robotâ€™s greeting.


#### What this contract does?

By deploying this simple contract, a little robot comes to life on the Avalanche Fuji testnet chain. When you call the `message()` function, the robot introduces itself with a friendly greeting.

## Submit Your Contract

Great job deploying your first contract ðŸŽ‰  

Next, copy your **contract address** from Remix.

Use the form below to submit your contract address:  

[Submit Contract Address](https://example.com/submit)

If the address is valid, you will receive an NFT certificate (coming soon âœ¨).
