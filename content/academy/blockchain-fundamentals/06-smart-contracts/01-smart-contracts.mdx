A **smart contract** is a self-executing program deployed on a blockchain.  
It defines rules and logic that run transparently and automatically when triggered by transactions.

### Why Are Smart Contracts Important?

Smart contracts serve as the foundation of decentralized applications:

- **Automation**: Execute agreements and processes automatically.
- **Transparency**: Code and execution are verifiable on-chain.
- **Security**: Immutable once deployed, resistant to tampering.
- **Programmability**: Enable tokens, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more.

Smart contracts transform blockchains from simple ledgers into programmable platforms, unlocking endless possibilities for decentralized innovation.
