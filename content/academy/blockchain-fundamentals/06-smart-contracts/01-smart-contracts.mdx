A **smart contract** is a self-executing program deployed on a blockchain.  
It defines rules and logic that run transparently and automatically when triggered by transactions.  
Smart contracts act as the foundation for decentralized applications and value transfer within blockchain ecosystems.

- **Ethereum**: ERC-20, ERC-721, and DeFi protocols built on Solidity smart contracts  
- **Avalanche C-Chain**: EVM-compatible smart contracts for DeFi, NFTs, and Subnets  
- **Polygon**: Smart contracts powering scalable decentralized applications  
- many more...

### The Role of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts serve multiple key roles within EVM-based blockchain networks, such as:

- **Automation**: Execute agreements and processes automatically without intermediaries.  
- **Transparency**: Code and execution are verifiable and immutable on-chain.  
- **Security**: Once deployed, smart contracts are resistant to tampering.  
- **Programmability**: Developers can design tokens, decentralized exchanges, DAOs, and more.

Smart contracts transform blockchains from simple ledgers into programmable platforms, enabling decentralized innovation and unlocking countless new use cases.
