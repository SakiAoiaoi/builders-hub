A **smart contract** is a self-executing program deployed on a blockchain.
Itâ€™s like a little robot living on the blockchain.
It defines rules and logic that run transparently and automatically when triggered by transactions.
In other words, the little robot only acts according to the rules that were programmed in advance.
Smart contracts act as the foundation for decentralized applications and value transfer within blockchain ecosystems.

### The Role of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts serve multiple key roles within EVM-based blockchain networks, such as:

- **Automation**: Execute agreements and processes automatically without intermediaries.  
- **Transparency**: Code and execution are verifiable and immutable on-chain.  
- **Security**: Once deployed, smart contracts are resistant to tampering.  
- **Programmability**: Developers can design tokens, decentralized exchanges, DAOs, and more.  

Smart contracts transform blockchains from simple ledgers into programmable platforms, enabling decentralized innovation and unlocking countless new use cases.
