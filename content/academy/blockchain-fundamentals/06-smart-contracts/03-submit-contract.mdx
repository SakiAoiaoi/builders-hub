# Interact with a Smart Contract

In this challenge, you will interact with a deployed contract on the Fuji Testnet.  
If you succeed, you will earn an NFT certificate.

## Get Test Funds

To deploy and interact, you need test AVAX on Fuji.  
[Get Test Funds](https://build.avax.network/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/get-test-funds)

## Steps

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).  
2. Create a new Solidity file (e.g., **HelloAvalanche.sol**) and paste:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract UnburnableToken {
    string public message = "Hello Avalanche!";
}
```

# Submit Your Contract

Great job deploying your first contract ðŸŽ‰  

Next, copy your **contract address** from Remix.
