In this section, you will learn how to interact with a deployed smart contract.  
You will explore the difference between reading state (calls) and updating state (transactions).

### 1. Reading State (call)

For the `HelloWorld` contract, you can call the `message()` function:

- Open the deployed contract in Remix or [SnowTrace Fuji](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/).  
- Call the `message()` function.  
- Reading data is **free** and does not consume gas.  

</Step>

### 2. Writing State (transaction)

Letâ€™s extend the contract with an update function:

```solidity
function setMessage(string calldata _msg) external {
    message = _msg;
}
